<!-- # Description

This repository represents the sleep staging classification work down using neural networks at Stanford University, and is intended primarily for research and historical reference.

Those interested in using the sleep staging classification methods that were developed from this should use the primary, [Stanford-STAGES](https://www.github.com/stanford-stages/stanford-stages) repository.

# sleep-staging


# sc_train.py is run by adding an option with the following format:
Example:
python sc_train.py --model ac_lh_ls_lstm

The ac specifies the CC model configuration, the lh specifies the complexity - high in this case, the ls specifies the window length - 15 seconds in this case, and lstm specifies that the model has memory.

To train a model, the sc_config.py should be changed to match the destination for training files, and similarly, to test a model (which has the same option as training) the destination for testing files should be changed. -->
